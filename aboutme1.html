<p>My name is Jason, I am 18 years old and I am from Weymouth, Massachusetts. My main interests are cars, sports, cologne and fishing. </p>
<img src="whippa2.jpg" alt="My Car"width="300" height="300";>
<p>This is my car,which I have spent way too much money on. I am doing my suspension all around, and plan on working on it more when I am back from break</p>
<p>The wheels are Rays Gramlight 57drs, with some Continental Extreme Contacts. Brand new this setup would cost about $3000 dollars, but I traded a few other sets of wheels, So ultimately I am in them less than a thousand dollars</p>
