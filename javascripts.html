<p>In high school I took Java, so I have completed numerous projects using Java. A lot of our curriculum revolved around making sites like quizzes, and games. Some of my favorite ones I did were quizzes that interacted with you based on your answer to a question. For example, If you said you liked a certain artist, the website would ask what your favorite song by that artist is. One of my favorite games I made was a makeshift shooter, there was an image of a squirt gun that the user was holding, and they would have to shoot a projectile at an enemy. I coded this by adding an entity that appeared when the user clicked or shot, and crossed the screen. If it collided with a target, the users score would increase. Unfortunately, I am unable to access any of my work from high school as it got deleted. However I did add an image of a squirt gun that I used for the project.   </p>
